# PDF-Chatbot-System

This project demonstrates a chatbot system that interacts with PDF files in a conversational manner. The chatbot extracts the text from a PDF document and allows users to query the content through a conversational interface. It uses LangChain and OpenAI models to provide responses based on the information in the PDF.

## Features
1. Extracts text from PDF files.
2. Splits text into smaller, manageable chunks for better processing.
3. Creates a vector store using FAISS to index the text.
4. Uses OpenAI's language models for conversational retrieval.
5. Stores chat history for context in a conversation.
