# PDF-Chatbot-System

This project demonstrates a chatbot system that interacts with PDF files in a conversational manner. The chatbot extracts the text from a PDF document and allows users to query the content through a conversational interface. It uses LangChain and OpenAI models to provide responses based on the information in the PDF.

Features

Splits text into smaller, manageable chunks for better processing.
Creates a vector store using FAISS to index the text.
