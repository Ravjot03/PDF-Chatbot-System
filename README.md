# Building a PDF Chatbot: Conversational AI Meets Document Interaction

This project demonstrates a chatbot system that interacts with PDF files in a conversational manner. The chatbot extracts the text from a PDF document and allows users to query the content through a conversational interface. It uses LangChain and OpenAI models to provide responses based on the information in the PDF.

## Features
1. Extracts text from PDF files.
2. Splits text into smaller, manageable chunks for better processing.
3. Creates a vector store using FAISS to index the text.
4. Uses OpenAI's language models for conversational retrieval.
5. Stores chat history for context in a conversation.

## Applications of the PDF Chatbot
This chatbot has many practical applications across different fields. Here are a few examples:

1. Educational Materials: Imagine being able to interact with textbooks or research papers. Students could ask their textbooks questions directly and get answers immediately, making studying more efficient.

2. Legal Documents: Lawyers and paralegals can use this system to interact with contracts, legal briefs, and statutes. It would save time and ensure that important clauses are never overlooked.

3. Manuals and Guides: Whether it's a product manual, user guide, or technical documentation, this chatbot can help users quickly find solutions without reading through pages of text.

4. Business Reports: Businesses could use it to analyze reports and extract insights, making meetings and decision-making processes faster and more informed.
